# 0x0A-argc_argv
### my pointsToNote.
# argc (ARGument Count) is an integer variable that stores the number of command-line arguments passed by the user including the name of the program. So if we pass a value to a program, the value of argc would be 2 (one for argument and one for program name)
# The value of argc should be non-negative.
# argv (ARGument Vector) is an array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
# If argc is greater than zero, the array elements from argv[0] to argv[argc-1] will contain pointers to strings.
# argv[0] is the name of the program , After that till argv[argc-1] every element is command -line arguments.
